# HouseHold Game
House Hold Game is a Python Command Line application that allows for users to be able to record their gaming titles to a library and have it
printed out to a spreadsheet and emailed over to them for their records.

## UX
### Users
The user should be able to interact with the command line and follow a series of questions that require input in order to advance to the next feature.
Once all the information has been inputted As as user I expect to receive this information recorded in a spreadsheet and sent over to the email that
I have provided.

The Instructions on the Command Line App are clear and concise and leaves little room for error.

### Application Structure
The Command line application will lead the user with a basic input of their gaming information:

1. Requests users information to be contacted in the form of an email.
2. Requests for Users Full name.
3. Requests for the current game title that they wish to input into the application.
4. Requests the information of what genre the game in question belongs to.
5. Requests which console platform the game belongs to (i.e. Playstation 5, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PC etc.)
6. Requests number of Hours played during game run time.
7. Requests what star rating would the user rank the game in their opinion (Star Rating ranging from 1* to 5*)
8. Updates details to worksheet and then once finished this will be sent over in an email to the user.
9. The Terminal Displays the final details:
  •Users Email Address
